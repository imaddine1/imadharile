          <h3>Digitalizing National & Regional Exams</h3>
          <p>
            I built endpoints to support the digitization process. To enhance the syncing experience, 
            I implemented multithreading, achieving smoother and faster data operations. Additionally, 
            I documented the system's services to help onboard new developers efficiently.

          <h3>Samad Project</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a web page integrated into the mobile app (created by another developer) that allows farmers to view detailed product information by selecting "More Details." 
            This feature enhanced the app's functionality and significantly improved the user experience.
